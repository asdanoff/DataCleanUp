# Cleanup on Row 7 Analysis

Using the edX data provided, we performed an analysis guided by the questions in the assignment.

A few notes:

1. Due to the high volume of data, we suggest that you launch Jupyter Notebook with the following command:  
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000000000

2. Some of our code is dependent on specific file paths. We note these points in the Jupyter notebooks. When you see one,
please replace the path with the relevant equivalent on your computer. Also note that we expect that you have the 'dirty_sample_small.csv' and 'dirty_sample_small_header.csv' datasets that you shared with us on your computer.
